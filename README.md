### Hi! Welcome. :blush:
<kbd>[<img title="Portuguese" alt="Portuguese" src="translations/portuguese/br.jpg" width="30">](translations/portuguese/README.br.md)</kbd>

I am Rodrigo. In the last seven years I worked at the bank sector. However, I've been wishing to work with IT for quite some time. So, after a long preparation, I quit my job to entirely dedicate myself to the dream of become an IT professional.

I am currently studying Information Systems, participating of a few Bootcamps and studying a lot by myself.

Thanks for visiting.
