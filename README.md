I am Rodrigo. In the last seven years I worked at the bank sector. However, I've been wishing to work with IT for quite some time.

So, after a long preparation, I quit my job to entirely dedicate myself to the dream of become an IT professional.

Currently I am studying Information Systems. Also, I am participating of a few Bootcamps and doing some self-education with the objective of finally start a career in IT.
